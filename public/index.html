      content="I present to you, the Weather-inator! This device will allow me to know the weather in any location, at any time! No longer will I be caught off guard by a sudden change in the forecast!
      The Weather-inator is my most evil invention yet! with the Weather-inator, I can plan my evil deeds accordingly. If I know that it's going to be a hot day, I can make sure to have plenty of ice on hand. If it's going to be a cold day, I can wear my evilest winter coat.
      The possibilities are endless! With the Weather-inator, I will always be one step ahead of the weather, and Perry the Platypus! There is nothing you can do to stop me, Perry the Platypus!
      Mwahahaha!
